# COPILOT EDITS OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES

## PRIME DIRECTIVE

    Avoid working on more than one file at a time.
    Multiple simultaneous edits to a file will cause corruption.
    Be chatting and teach about what you are doing while coding.

## LARGE FILE & COMPLEX CHANGE PROTOCOL

### MANDATORY PLANNING PHASE

    When working with large files (>300 lines) or complex changes:
    	1. ALWAYS start by creating a detailed plan BEFORE making any edits
            2. Your plan MUST include:
                   - All functions/sections that need modification
                   - The order in which changes should be applied
                   - Dependencies between changes
                   - Estimated number of separate edits required

            3. Format your plan as:

## PROPOSED EDIT PLAN

    Working with: [filename]
    Total planned edits: [number]

### MAKING EDITS

    - Focus on one conceptual change at a time
    - Show clear "before" and "after" snippets when proposing changes
    - Include concise explanations of what changed and why
    - Always check if the edit maintains the project's coding style

### Edit sequence:

    1. [First specific change] - Purpose: [why]
    2. [Second specific change] - Purpose: [why]
    3. Do you approve this plan? I'll proceed with Edit [number] after your confirmation.
    4. WAIT for explicit user confirmation before making ANY edits when user ok edit [number]


### EXECUTION PHASE

    - After each individual edit, clearly indicate progress:
    	"✅ Completed edit [#] of [total]. Ready for next edit?"
    - If you discover additional needed changes during editing:
    - STOP and update the plan
    - Get approval before continuing


### REFACTORING GUIDANCE

    When refactoring large files:
    - Break work into logical, independently functional chunks
    - Ensure each intermediate state maintains functionality
    - Consider temporary duplication as a valid interim step
    - Always indicate the refactoring pattern being applied


### RATE LIMIT AVOIDANCE

    - For very large files, suggest splitting changes across multiple sessions
    - Prioritize changes that are logically complete units
    - Always provide clear stopping points


## General Requirements

    Use modern technologies as described below for all code suggestions. Prioritize clean, maintainable code with appropriate comments.


### Accessibility

    - Ensure compliance with **WCAG 2.1** AA level minimum, AAA whenever feasible.
    - Always suggest:
    - Labels for form fields.
    - Proper **ARIA** roles and attributes.
    - Adequate color contrast.
    - Alternative texts (`alt`, `aria-label`) for media elements.
    - Semantic HTML for clear structure.
    - Tools like **Lighthouse** for audits.


## Browser Compatibility

    - Prioritize feature detection (`if ('fetch' in window)` etc.).
        - Support latest two stable releases of major browsers:
    - Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari (macOS/iOS)
        - Emphasize progressive enhancement with polyfills or bundlers (e.g., **Babel**, **Vite**) as needed.


## PHP Requirements

    - **Target Version**: PHP 8.1 or higher
    - **Features to Use**:
    - Named arguments
    - Constructor property promotion
    - Union types and nullable types
    - Match expressions
    - Nullsafe operator (`?->`)
    - Attributes instead of annotations
    - Typed properties with appropriate type declarations
    - Return type declarations
    - Enumerations (`enum`)
    - Readonly properties
    - Emphasize strict property typing in all generated code.
    - **Coding Standards**:
    - Follow PSR-12 coding standards
    - Use strict typing with `declare(strict_types=1);`
    - Prefer composition over inheritance
    - Use dependency injection
    - **Static Analysis:**
    - Include PHPDoc blocks compatible with PHPStan or Psalm for static analysis
    - **Error Handling:**
    - Use exceptions consistently for error handling and avoid suppressing errors.
    - Provide meaningful, clear exception messages and proper exception types.


## HTML/CSS Requirements

    - **HTML**:
    - Use HTML5 semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, `<search>`, etc.)
    - Include appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
    - Ensure valid markup that passes W3C validation
    - Use responsive design practices
    - Optimize images using modern formats (`WebP`, `AVIF`)
    - Include `loading="lazy"` on images where applicable
    - Generate `srcset` and `sizes` attributes for responsive images when relevant
    - Prioritize SEO-friendly elements (`<title>`, `<meta description>`, Open Graph tags)

    - **CSS**:
    - Use modern CSS features including:
    - CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
    - CSS Custom Properties (variables)
    - CSS animations and transitions
    - Media queries for responsive design
    - Logical properties (`margin-inline`, `padding-block`, etc.)
    - Modern selectors (`:is()`, `:where()`, `:has()`)
    - Follow BEM or similar methodology for class naming
    - Use CSS nesting where appropriate
    - Include dark mode support with `prefers-color-scheme`
    - Prioritize modern, performant fonts and variable fonts for smaller file sizes
    - Use modern units (`rem`, `vh`, `vw`) instead of traditional pixels (`px`) for better responsiveness


## JavaScript Requirements

    - **Minimum Compatibility**: ECMAScript 2020 (ES11) or higher
    - **Features to Use**:
    - Arrow functions
    - Template literals
    - Destructuring assignment
    - Spread/rest operators
    - Async/await for asynchronous code
    - Classes with proper inheritance when OOP is needed
    - Object shorthand notation
    - Optional chaining (`?.`)
    - Nullish coalescing (`??`)
    - Dynamic imports
    - BigInt for large integers
    - `Promise.allSettled()`
    - `String.prototype.matchAll()`
    - `globalThis` object
    - Private class fields and methods
    - Export * as namespace syntax
    - Array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `flatMap`, etc.)
    - **Avoid**:
    - `var` keyword (use `const` and `let`)
    - jQuery or any external libraries
    - Callback-based asynchronous patterns when promises can be used
    - Internet Explorer compatibility
    - Legacy module formats (use ES modules)
    - Limit use of `eval()` due to security risks
    - **Performance Considerations:**
    - Recommend code splitting and dynamic imports for lazy loading
    **Error Handling**:
    - Use `try-catch` blocks **consistently** for asynchronous and API calls, and handle promise rejections explicitly.
    - Differentiate among:
    - **Network errors** (e.g., timeouts, server errors, rate-limiting)
    - **Functional/business logic errors** (logical missteps, invalid user input, validation failures)
    - **Runtime exceptions** (unexpected errors such as null references)
    - Provide **user-friendly** error messages (e.g., “Something went wrong. Please try again shortly.”) and log more technical details to dev/ops (e.g., via a logging service).
    - Consider a central error handler function or global event (e.g., `window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection')`) to consolidate reporting.
    - Carefully handle and validate JSON responses, incorrect HTTP status codes, etc.
